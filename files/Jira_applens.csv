We need these {color:#bf2600}*Think Central notifications to be stopped immediately* {color}as it could be perceived to be in violation of the adoption rules. What we think happen is there is one charter school in St. Johns but it was sent out 47 different times to various schools and admins.

Does TC allow the same user to be associated to more than one school?
Or does it only do that by appending the PID onto the username?

These are all the PIDs that user is mapped to, in Ed (IDS), there are 20 (not 47):

{color:#ff5630}*_TC allow the same user to be associated to more than one school?_*{color}

TC doesn’t not allow the same username to be associated to more than one school within same district as we have the district level uniqueness for username.

{color:#ff5630}*_Or does it only do that by appending the PID onto the username?_*{color}

We have a concept of Account linking where a user account can be mapped to two schools within same district with same usernames one appended with PID and the other without PID. We can switch between the profiles using Switch Profile option as below.

As part of *CHG0823681*, the Reporting Service instances were stopped and the complete termination will be done on *23rd October* after a certain grace period.

After stopping the instances, we got pager duty alerts and then the corresponding Test run related to Reporting Service was skipped. 

Now the Satellite Application test run contains only Adaptive service and Assignment service test runs.

I have registered the instance back to load balancer via ELB plans and triggered the daily restart plan manually and now it was completed successfully.

Currently *facing errors* in the test files—*working on resolving them*. Once fixed, the next steps will include updating dependencies, refactoring deprecated APIs, and validating the application through testing.

Currently, we are in the process of procuring an SSL certificate to be configured at the Load Balancer (LB) for the new Production environment. This step is part of the ongoing migration of the Production server from Windows Server 2012R2 to Windows Server 2022.

The completion of the SSL configuration and migration activities is expected to resolve the majority of the outstanding vulnerabilities in the ODMS Production environment.",,,,,,,,,,;07/Aug/25 9:56 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;07/Aug/25 9:57 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;07/Aug/25 9:57 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;07/Aug/25 9:57 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;07/Aug/25 9:57 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Aug/25 9:19 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Aug/25 9:19 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Aug/25 9:20 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;21/Aug/25 8:39 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;21/Aug/25 8:39 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;28/Aug/25 9:55 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;28/Aug/25 9:55 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;04/Sep/25 9:52 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;04/Sep/25 9:52 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;04/Sep/25 9:52 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;04/Sep/25 9:52 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;04/Sep/25 9:53 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;11/Sep/25 9:17 PM;5d0a7544-5368-48e5-8031-2a0c39f0c42f;18000,;11/Sep/25 9:18 PM;5d0a7544-5368-48e5-8031-2a0c39f0c42f;18000,;11/Sep/25 9:19 PM;5d0a7544-5368-48e5-8031-2a0c39f0c42f;18000,;11/Sep/25 9:20 PM;5d0a7544-5368-48e5-8031-2a0c39f0c42f;18000,;11/Sep/25 9:20 PM;5d0a7544-5368-48e5-8031-2a0c39f0c42f;18000,;11/Sep/25 9:26 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;11/Sep/25 9:27 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;11/Sep/25 9:27 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;11/Sep/25 9:27 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;18/Sep/25 10:30 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;18/Sep/25 10:31 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;18/Sep/25 10:32 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;18/Sep/25 10:32 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;18/Sep/25 10:32 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;25/Sep/25 11:23 AM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;25/Sep/25 11:23 AM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;25/Sep/25 11:23 AM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;25/Sep/25 11:24 AM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;25/Sep/25 11:24 AM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;02/Oct/25 9:59 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;02/Oct/25 9:59 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;02/Oct/25 9:59 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;02/Oct/25 10:00 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;23/Oct/25 9:27 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;23/Oct/25 9:28 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;30/Oct/25 12:29 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;30/Oct/25 12:29 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;30/Oct/25 12:29 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;30/Oct/25 12:29 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;30/Oct/25 12:29 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;06/Nov/25 8:50 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;18000,;06/Nov/25 8:53 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Nov/25 8:42 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Nov/25 8:42 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Nov/25 8:42 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Nov/25 8:42 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,;13/Nov/25 8:43 PM;191867c9-121b-4345-a3ae-0ef56725d4e3;32400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1663200,,,0,1663200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"* SSL certificate procured and installed successfully at LB for new Prod.

[~accountid:557058:cb394c07-b804-4cfb-a1b4-b2d305264bda], We analyzed the feature request and came up with some questions below and please provide your response for the questions as follow:

 
 # How many teachers exactly needed while creating a Class? Only one Secondary Teacher as shown in the attached document? Or more?

 
 # When Teacher logs in, does Teacher want to add a Secondary Teacher (Which is not possible with Teacher Level Access in ODMS System, as teacher can only see his/her name in the dropdown while creating a class)?

 
 # When Secondary Teacher logs in, does Secondary Teacher want to manage assessments, class, and student details?


Thanks and Regards,
Durga Bhavani Racha.

Tushar Baghel","29/Sep/25 12:13 AM;712020:ad7ca951-e27e-4c33-848e-52bf6fa1b3cc;Hi [~accountid:70121:955b9a6b-815b-40ca-b7df-0c797eacfd1f] ,

As part of this request, I processed the username [*Shira.Meadows@hmhco.com*|mailto:Shira.Meadows@hmhco.com].

However, I noticed that the *ED SUPPORT TOOL UI* is displaying an incorrect username for the teacher.
Please refer to the screenshot below: 

!image-20250929-070955.png|width=91.66666666666666%,alt=""image-20250929-070955.png""!

The *output file* reflects the correct usernames for both the teacher and the student, as shown here:

!image-20250929-071013.png|width=100%,alt=""image-20250929-071013.png""!

It looks like the user account already exists as teacher which resulted to ignore the one we provided in the csv file. 

Could you please look into this discrepancy.


Thanks,
Tushar Baghel

Please find below the details for the Sample word expiration logic.

# The Code logic Dynamically sets the Expiration date based on the duration provided by Sample Word Object. And then this duration is added to current date to calculate the expiration date.

_For example, I have created a new sample user account today so it will consider current date .i.e._ *_15-09-2025_* _and duration for the reported sample word_ *_360_* _which is added into current date and so the sample user account Expiration date is set as_ *_10-09-2026._*

 2. If the calculated expiration date is before the expiration date of the Sample-Word’s *Duration,* then the expiration date of user is set to calculated date. 

{color:#ff5630}*We don’t have the privilege to set / extend the expiration date of sample user accounts unlike the expiration of sample words.*{color}

Thanks for the info and apologies for doubling up on the ISRs.

Just want to check I have this right.

The sample word “mathexpressions18CC” is set to 12/31/29 so if someone logs in and they have no access to the programs the expiry date on that account has expired, they just need to set up as an evaluator again?

Expiration date of Eval User account
Expiration date of Sample/Access word
Expiration date of a Program 

Each of these expiration dates are independent to each other. 

If a Program is expired creating new user accounts will not help, we/my team has the authority to extend the program exp date which can be requested via ISRs in situations like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,15/Sep/25 9:55 AM

*Acceptance Criteria*
Produce Knewton Product User Counts report with the data that represents the number of real *TC PROD* users, teachers and students, entitled to Knewton products who logged in between 1st August and 31st August 2025.

The header of the report contains: Report title
Reporting time interval
A sum of: Count of every teacher per Knewton product the teacher is entitled to if the teacher logged into TC between 1st August and 31st August 2025.
Count of every student per Knewton product assigned to the student's classes if the student logged into TC between 1st August and 31st August 2025.

There is one count per user per Knewton product and if a user has access to more than one product, they are counted for each product, e.g. 2 products => count the user twice.
Any user who has not logged in between 1st August and 31st August 2025 despite having access to a Knewton product, is not included in the count.
The body of the report contains: Knowledge Graph Id
User Id
Knewton product ISBN
Date of user's last login
Time of user's last login

The data will be tagged with ""Teacher"" vs ""Student""

*Acceptance Criteria*
Produce Knewton Product User Counts report with the data that represents the number of real *HMO PROD* users, teachers and students, entitled to Knewton products who logged in between 1st August and 31st August 2025.

The header of the report contains: Report title
Reporting time interval
A sum of: Count of every teacher per Knewton product the teacher is entitled to if the teacher logged into HMO between 1st August and 31st August 2025.
Count of every student per Knewton product assigned to the student's classes if the student logged into HMO between 1st August and 31st August 2025.

There is one count per user per Knewton product and if a user has access to more than one product, they are counted for each product, e.g. 2 products => count the user twice.
Any user who has not logged in between 1st August and 31st August 2025 despite having access to a Knewton product, is not included in the count.
The body of the report contains: Knowledge Graph Id
User Id
Knewton product ISBN
Date of user's last login
Time of user's last login

The data will be tagged with ""Teacher"" vs ""Student""

*Notes:*
Report should be stored in the following location:

For the Organization “*HMH Coaching-92031624*“, we could see all the available entitlements were valid till 2033 or 2034 or 2035.

But for the organization “*Loop State Test-92035880*”, all the available entitlements are expired. Please confirm whether we have to re-add all the available entitlements which are expired.

h4. 1. *Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)*

h4.  2.*Run npm Commands in the Project Directory:*

h4. *i)* Once npm is installed and working, navigate to your project directory (where {{*package.json*}} is located) 

h4. cmd :    cd C:\HMH source code\HTE-770Dashboard\Application\HMH.WorkBench.UI, and then 

3.*Install express to required version*

*cmd:* npm install express@4.0.0.

Created a PR to upgrade package changes :[https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/548|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/548] Changes were pushed to the {{Dev}} branch, and the *""Retest now""* button was clicked in the Snyk portal to address the high vulnerability.
As a result, *1 high vulnerability ticket* dependent on this package was resolved.

and further I have updated this package to 4.17.3 which resolves 3 additional high vulnerabilities [https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/551|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/551]
*So, 4 High,5 medium,2 low vulnerability tickets* which are dependent on this have been *resolved*.

* Experience API (xAPI) is public API specification for learning record store. It is JSON-based REST API.
* XAPI was originally created to log the user experience, When a user clicks on the UI i.e., certain part of a screen, clicks a button, option or something, we would record all these events using this xAPI and uses Dynamo DB.
* *Note*: - The biggest problem with XAPI is the way it's designed to record events. So if user clicks answer A and then B, then clicks answer C, that doesn't do an update.
It records three events API and three records get stored in the database and that's the way it should be done.
So if a user clicks all the answers like four or five times, you could have like 20 or however many records created in xAPI, but only the very last record actually utilized.
* *Security Vulnerabilities*: No Critical risks on xAPI as of 05.06.2025

Team,

XAPI -

* XAPI was originally created to log the user experience, When a user clicks on the UI i.e., certain part of a screen, clicks a button, option or something, we would record all these events using this XAPI and uses Dynamo DB.
* *Note*: - The biggest problem with XAPI is the way because it's designed to record events. So if user clicks answer A and then B, then clicks answer C, that doesn't do an update.
It records three events API and three records get stored in the database and that's the way it should be done.
So if a user clicks all the answers like four or five times, you could have like 20 or however many records created in X API, but only the very last record actually utilized.

Analysis of the AWS console load balancer for XAPI(HMHVPC01-XAPI-PROD-APP) we observed the following details:

*Request Count*: The total number of requests was *1062* over the past 5 months.

*Log file review (*D:\Applications\logs\xapi) : Upon investigating the log files indicates an warning of *authentication issue* where the Authorization was either *invalid* or *missing* or *empty* in the HTTP request security tokens so couldn’t able to trace the user details.

 ",15/May/25 3:31 AM;712020:a51f8191-37c4-4f60-9ef0-f26299f55162;Investigating the log details further to trace the user information .,"20/May/25 12:26 AM;712020:a51f8191-37c4-4f60-9ef0-f26299f55162;*Findings*:

After investigating the log files found that multiple log entries indicate authentication failures with the following messages:

* Invalid authentication token or configuration.
* Authentication issue - Authorization header providing underlying exception message: Invalid Security Token.

This confirms that the application is receiving authentication request, but the security token provided (in the Authorization header) is not valid.

*Active HMOF Platform Users Accessing XAPI:*

The following live production users are actively consuming the XAPI service via the HMOF platform:

1.Monica Carlow

2.DELORA NICHOLAS

3.Julia Martin

4.Kailynn Leyba

5.Lilliana King etc,..

*Example JWT Analysis:*

1.For User: *DELORA NICHOLAS*

*Conclusion*:

Authentication failures are occurring for active HMOF users attempting to access the XAPI service due to invalid or unverified JWT tokens and I could see the active users on the HMOF platform.

We have not able to identify the cause for the authentication failures possible issues are:

* Invalid token/Expried token.
* Incorrect Authorization header
* Configuration drift

and also there are no active CSI tickets or related issue tickets , Considering this shall we shutdown the server in the INT environment to observer the impact?  where we only have invalid hits for this service.

# The db schema - what fields does it capture?
# export of the data we have in the xAPI db. if it’s huge, can you at least show me a slice of the data - let’s day for the last year or two.
# Are there any identifiers in there that would help us figure out which content products/programs have xAPI implemented?
# Can we we see if any services or apps or user accounts (i.e. internal to HMH) have access to the db - to try to understand who or what may have been consuming this data in the past?

On the consumer side, it looks like this XAPI is packaged inside the DLO contents.

Could we please check with the content team on where and all this package is included, and this endpoint calls *api/xAPI/v1/statements* (they can do the search on their code base)?

1.I have checked the xAPI CERT environment in AWS DynamoDB, where I don't have access to check the prod environment.

The below listed fields(attributes) are present for XAPI in dynamodb*.*

*statement_id*  

*actor_id* 

*creator* 

*creator_object_id*

*data* 

*lastupdate_timestamp* 

*object_id* 

*object_type* 

*stored_timestamp* 

*verb_id* 

*voided* 

2.Attached the xAPI CERT data for reference:

[^xapi-cert data.csv]

# No, we only have the creator id(ref_uuid) but using which also we couldn’t able to find the content i think the only way to find the content products/programs is through the content team.
# we only able to access the XAPI services using the post and get methods other than this we don't have any access.

Please let me know if we need to export the database in production, I can create a BR ticket for it!

request = sanitizeRequest(request);

 

However, *this did not resolve the SSRF issue*, as the root cause lies earlier in the flow — where headers are first set on the request object (e.g., line 593). Sanitizing at invokeRequest is too late since tainted input already flows in.

validate the scripts in CAS CERT Database:

*step 1: Import Platform Data*

 Import the CSV files received from TC and HMOF teams into:

*  Annotator_Purge_TC (for TC users)
* Annotator_Purge_HMOF(for HMOF users)
* use sql server import data task to load the files.
* These staging tables help you separate platform sources before purging.

*Step 2:Transfer Inactive Users to Main table*

From both staging tables, insert only users marked as inactive (Platform_status='N') into the main purge table(Annotator_Purge):

{noformat}INSERT INTO Annotator_Purge (...)
SELECT ...
FROM Annotator_Purge_TC
WHERE Annotator_Platform_Status = 'N';{noformat}

{noformat}INSERT INTO Annotator_Purge (...)
SELECT ...
FROM Annotator_Purge_HMOF
WHERE Annotator_Platform_Status = 'N';{noformat}

*Step 3:Update Platform and Role Info:*

Run the script Update_PlatformAndRole.sql to Populate:

* Annotator_Platform_id and Annotator_Role_Id into Annotator_Purge table.

This ensures the purge logic can filter users correctly.

Scripts available here: [https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/contentAPIServices-cas/tree/Release-2.2.0/DataArchival/DBScripts|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/contentAPIServices-cas/tree/Release-2.2.0/DataArchival/DBScripts]

*Step 4:Identify Batch Ranges:*

2 ways of identifying the batch : 

*option 1: grouped by platform and role id:*

This method filters users by platform and role before purging:

SELECT MIN(Id) AS MinId, MAX(Id) AS MaxId
FROM Annotator_Purge
WHERE Annotator_Platform_Id = [PlatformId]
  AND Annotator_Role_Id = [RoleId]
AND Annotator_Platform_Status = 'N';

Examples:

HMOF Students->Platform_id=1, Role_id = 8 etc,.

TC Teachers->Platform_Id=4,Role_id = 2 etc,.

*Option 2:batch by total record count:*

This method assumes all users in Annotator_purge are inactive and ready to purge:

SELECT MIN(Id), MAX(Id)
FROM Annotator_Purge;

Then divide into chunks:

* Batch 1: Ids 1–1000
* Batch 2: Ids 1001–2000

*Step 5: Run Purge in Batches*

Use Delete In Batch-Scripts.sql to loop through the Id Range.

For each record:

# Checks if the record is eligible (Platform_status='N')
# Calls purgeuserdatabyannotatorId stored procedure.
# Updates purgestatus and purgedate if successful.
# Logs or prints errors if purge fails

*Step 6:Review Errors*

After each batch,check:

SELECT * FROM Annotator_Purge_Errors
ORDER BY Error_Timestamp DESC;

* Investigate validation failures or exceptions.
* Retry based on error type.

This ticket will track the actions taken towards it.

Steps to follow:

* Delete/remove old AMIs and keep only recent AMI 
* Raise a BR ticket to remove/delete the AMIs
* Once a BR is closed, check with Infosec to see if that’s reflecting in ORCA & if number of vulnerabilities is reduced for Mature.

# *Jenkins related AMIs are contributing nearly 90K vulnerabilities*

The students who experienced the glitch (in my class and others) were in the process of taking the Growth Measure assessment. They had completed a large portion of the test and were at the end of doing nonsense words. I do not know which question they were doing, but it was during the nonsense word portion of the assessment (3 word choices, and they were supposed to listen to the word spoken and select the word that looked like what they heard). Every child who experienced the glitch answered one of these questions, and the next page that popped up was the error page that told students to get help from the teacher because there was a technical issue.","09/Oct/25 9:59 AM;70121:6c18a1e2-ebad-4be1-a1e6-268664609a10;Sample student UN: [gidcumbz37@okemosk12.net|mailto:gidcumbz37@okemosk12.net]

The students were given a Growth Measure Assessment in the wrong grade. No matter what reason that was, we will not be able to correct the assessment grade for the affected students. This is due to the complex data in the backend. *We highly recommend the teacher to reassign a new BOY Growth Measue Assessments* for these students to take asap. This way, their Growth Reports will reflect the correct test grade for BOY. Along the school year, when they take MOY and EOY tests, the progress data will be calculated properly.

The investigation will take time, and we wouldn't want students to miss the window of time to complete the BOY in 5th grade. Thank you.

This indicates that the map is to ED only.  It is believed that the application was set to “7” (aka TC.HRW.ED) during batch 3214

Since the errors are not showing up in batch 3224, it is believed that the customer changed the Applications for this school to stop it from being sent to HRW.  It is confirmed that these users are in batch 3224 and (mostly) associated with the same school (3024) ","21/Oct/25 9:41 AM;712020:81e53f36-d4ab-48f8-97bd-8cb23f2997d7;Issue is not showing up in batch 3224.
It is believed that this was due to an incorrect Org Mapping where the customer was trying to roster to HRW unintentionally from their OneRoster set.  
This appears to have been corrected

Note that there are two other schools, identified in the prior comment, which are still set to roster to HRW from the OneRoster feed.  This should probably be corrected.

Upon investigating the CLM database for ISBN 9781328785039 and 9781328927583, we observed that the latest order was processed on *28-08-2024 at 5:18:34 PM* with *Sales Order No. 0097176927*. The associated subscription has an end date of *27-08-2025 at 12:00 AM*.

For reference, please find the attached screenshot.

* These updates are now reflected in the TC platform, causing the resources to appear as *expired* and hence *not visible*.

*Conclusion:*

* This behaviour is *as per design*.
* The TC platform is correctly reflecting the updated subscription end dates from the processed orders.

 

*Resolving the ticket* as the system is functioning as expected.

* These updates are now reflected in the TC platform, causing the resources to appear as *expired* and hence *not visible*.

*Conclusion:*

* This behaviour is *as per design*.
* The TC platform is correctly reflecting the updated subscription end dates from the processed orders.

Can we check with the relevant team who supports LTI launch. 

In addition i also verified the below two scenarios:

* Test launch for other students in same district - Verified for two students, those accounts also face same issue
* Test launch for test profiles in test district - Able to launch the test and completed

Based on this we feel that the issue is specific to this district.

+*Note:*+ The last submitted test for this entire district is on Sep 05th and is of Math Adaptive test. After that no test was submitted of any type.

Upon analysis, we found the below observations.

The reported assignment, *Lesson 1 Comprehension* belongs to the class “*LAURA HATCHER - TK-6 --240-301*” which is inactive.

*As per current working functionality, If a class is inactive then we cannot score the assignments which are mapped to that class.* 

The Class which is currently active is “+Laura Hatcher - TK-6 - 3rd Grade-240-301+“

Hence closing this ticket as working by design.

Yes the class “Laura Hatcher - TK-6 - 3rd Grade-240-301” was the only active one for the reported teacher. (In the screenshot added by Tier 2 we could see this class bit in the comment its different which is inactive)

But the reported assignment mentioned is mapped to a different class(*LAURA HATCHER - TK-6 --240-301*) which is inactive. Please checkout the previous comment from our end.

* In *TC* and *HMO* databases, the institution {{FTYPE}} is recorded as *10 (Catholic School)*.
* In the *CLM* database, the institution type is listed as *09 (Private School)*.

This discrepancy in institution type is the root cause of the reported error.

*Resolution:* We coordinated with the *CLM team* to re-sync the organization data to ensure consistency across all systems. The sync has been successfully completed for both *TC* and *HMO*, and the institution type is now aligned.

 !School_Admin_jtedrick.png|thumbnail! 

As per the records in *ELSVC.IDM_BATCH_IMPORT* table, we could find the import for batch 21 is uploaded by *dirby@columbuscatholic.org* who is a *District Administrator* mapped to the organization *Diocese of Columbus Ed Office (00802717)* under which the reported organization *St Mary School (00803278)* is tagged earlier.

After the resync of organization in CLM, the *St Mary School (00803278)* is moved from the DISTPID 00802717 to Independent School (DISTPID-00803278) and the 1943 error thrown is valid as the importing District admin is mapped to old DISTPID 00802717 and the users that are imported has to be mapped to the DISTPID 00803278. 

Could you please re-import the latest batch via School Admin login and let us know in case of any issues ?

Feature Request - Shelly would like the system to be smart enough to know when students are being removed/added or grade levels are being altered through every .CSV roster. 

Currently: If a user is changing grade levels, the system will not allow the .CSV file to upload because the user is already in the system. A workaround is to upload a nearly blank (with a single dummy user) to wipe out all old data to allow new data to be uploaded.","Operating System: Windows 10

","22/Sep/25 11:12 AM;557058:bb71b0f4-b983-46c1-803e-241a4d8a40a9;On further analysis, we found that the Cross reference mapping for the PID *12723680* is missing in TC and HMO platforms even though the PID is available in CLM. 

After the Resync of organization from CLM platform, the Cross reference mapping is available in TC and HMO.

!Cross_Reference.png|width=384,height=287,alt=""Cross_Reference.png""!

[~accountid:712020:5a0e0f5e-96cd-42d2-83d2-fe37b57420b7]  The issue can be routed back to us and we will monitor the import batches since the cross referencing would resolve the 1943 error in HRW platform.

The duplicate school name issue within same district will be analyzed by ELM team.

Issue: Interview Data is wrong in reporting
1. Makaio – This student is on the roster and has not been given an interview, but the report incorrectly shows that he participated in one.
2. Coral and Luke – Both students appear twice on the full class report. They only completed Interview 8, yet the data also shows additional Interviews 6 and 7, which they did not take.
3. Naomi – The report shows her as having completed Interview 7, but she only took Interview 4.
4. Aiden - This student in Jerome's class. He completed interview 6 and was submitted. Iis showing he only went up to question 6.6 and that he was given interview 7 and he was not given interview 7. 

User(s) Affected(PID associated to the account(s) Must also be included): Admin: merarie.carrasquilla@k12.hi.us

Pending response or closure. ,"30/Sep/25 8:13 AM;712020:cbb1168a-c517-41b1-925b-3ff13ff06879;Per Customer: Makaio's data continues to be incorrect. He is one of our students on campus who does not participate in any interviews. He has not participate in any interviews this year. As for the other students, interviews are still showing up that they were not administered. 

On a separate note, I have another 3rd grade teacher Elyssa Farmer, that appeared to show 2 interviews given to her entire class. Initially, she did not administer any interviews for the entire class, and data was showing up for each of her students from the previous year. She is the only teacher this happened to where it appears the previous year data transferred. We were not sure what happened but continued to interview her class, in which they have only done one interview but her data is showing both last year and this years data. She also shows up as a student in her data. 

This is not the same issue with Joshua's class, which is showing the exact opposite problem. ","01/Oct/25 12:20 AM;712020:ce251a5d-ebe0-4951-bb6c-08aca642a1cc;Thank you for the additional clarification.

As per the system’s functionality, the reporting view is designed to show all interviews administered by the class teacher, including those from previous academic years for existing students. For new users, only the current year’s interview data will be displayed.

Based on our validation:

* *Makaio* has completed Interviews 7 and 8, which are correctly reflected in the report. If he was not intended to participate, this may need to be reviewed at the data entry or assignment level.
* The discrepancies observed in *Elyssa Farmer’s* class are consistent with expected behavior for returning students, where previous year data is retained. Her appearance as a student may be due to a role configuration issue .
* *Joshua’s class* shows data aligned with the current year and teacher assignments, and no reporting deviations were found.

All of the students are returning students with the exception of a few and those that moved on to middle school,"06/Oct/25 10:59 PM;712020:ce251a5d-ebe0-4951-bb6c-08aca642a1cc;The reason Elyssa Farmer’s class shows interview data from the previous year while others do not is likely due to how user and class associations were carried over in the system.

If Elyssa retained the same class roster or student associations from the previous academic year, and those students are returning users, their historical interview data would continue to appear in the reporting view. This is expected behavior for returning students and teachers. In contrast, if other teachers had their rosters reset or reassigned for the new year, the system would only show data from the current academic year.

Based on the productId the results are getting changed. Can we please check with relevant team for their thoughts as well which might help to find the root cause.

One Search is working as expected as the customer does not have an entitlement to the Product Id inlcuded in the call that is being submitted. When I look at the entitlements that exist for Math Growth Measure these are the entitlements that I see:

{noformat}      {
        ""learningResourceRefId"": ""l_f3cda56d-5d98-490b-ab1e-854124e6909a_se"",

        ""program"": ""MA_NL_SGM_EN_02"",
        ""isExpired"": ""false"",
        ""licenseCount"": ""144"",
        ""productBundleIdentifier"": {
          ""type"": """",
          ""value"": """"
        },
        ""roleTypes"": ""student""
      },
      {
        ""learningResourceRefId"": ""l_f3cda56d-5d98-490b-ab1e-854124e6909a"",
        ""orgRefId"": ""2399437e-3507-41ce-b10b-8827fa30b20d"",
        ""program"": ""MA_NL_SGM_EN_02"",
        ""isExpired"": ""false"",
        ""licenseCount"": ""7"",
        ""productBundleIdentifier"": {
          ""type"": """",
          ""value"": """"
        },
        ""roleTypes"": ""teacher""
      },{noformat}

The UI however, is submiting a request to return the assessment resources associated with Product Id: l_54e5d98a-c1a8-4bc4-b774-4967508be839 and as you can see, neither of those is the Product Id that the customer is entitled to.

The request that includes the Prgram Code of MA_NL_SGM_EN_02 works because it returns all of the resources associated with both of the products that are associated with the program code.

I don’t know whether this is an entitlement issue within OAC or a hard coding issue within the Ed UI because when I look in MDS at this program code there are 3 products and 3 ISBN’s associated with the Math Growth Measure program as follows and I wouldn’t know what the correct ones should be:

User(s) Affected: waronson@schools.nyc.gov

Replication:
1. Log in to ThinkCentral with the teacher UN: waronson@schools.nyc.gov
2. Go to Manage Classes, select the class named 26Q094.501.00, and click View Class Roster. This class has 25 students, but the teacher says there should be 27 students in the class.
3. Select the class named Listening, Speaking, and Language 5 (26Q094.ELNJ5.534849) and the class named Mathematics 5 (26Q094.MMNJ5.534849). The same 25 students are listed in these 2 classes that are listed in the first class.
4. Select the class named Mathematics 5 (26Q094.MMNJ5.6523403. The teacher says this class is correct with only 2 students.
5. Select the class named Social-Emotional Development 5 (26Q094.GENJ5.534849). This class has the same 25 students as the previous classes have.

Actual Results: Classes are not syncing due to teacher not being listed in classassignments file.

Expected Results: The teacher expects her classes to be rostered correctly.

NOTE- The teacher says there should be a 531 class that’s missing, but she doesn’t have any other information about the class except class 531.

The most recent batch is 6994 (2025-10-13).  

Teacher [WAronson@schools.nyc.gov|mailto:WAronson@schools.nyc.gov] (userrefid daed4dbc-6fe7-49c8-83b5-23ba57b6968a) is part of the roster file and is associated with 10 classes in the roster file, one of which is “26Q094.501.00” (sectionrefid f9e2a82a-9921-4f7b-822a-04af9760ade8).  There are 26 students in the roster file for this class, and that count is matched in IDS.  

Of the 10 classes that are in the roster feed, there are 5 classes where this teacher is the only teacher. The remaining 5 classes, the teacher is one of 2-4 teachers. Because lead teacher is based on the username of the user, this teacher is unlikely to be marked as lead teacher for any of these other classes.  The classes where she is the only teacher are classlocalid 26Q094.501.00, 26Q094.ELNJ5.534849, 26Q094.GENJ5.534849, 26Q094.MMNJ5.534849, 26Q094.MMNJ5.6523403.  Since TC does not support co-teachers, we expect that these will be the only classes created for her in TC. 

In TC, there are 5 classes associated with this teacher.

These match the classes as predicted from rostering.  There are 26 students in class “26Q094.501.00” per a class export from TC.

* However, *Student resources for Grade 2* are *missing* from this view, despite active student licenses.

We will now proceed to *analyze the product list views* associated with the resources to identify any discrepancies or missing mappings that could be causing this issue","17/Sep/25 12:54 AM;712020:ad7ca951-e27e-4c33-848e-52bf6fa1b3cc;We could see that the student resources you are expecting in Grade 2 is mapped to different program '*Math In Focus'.*

Issue: Schools reflecting in Ed are not reflecting in HRW or TCT. Customer master data team attempted twice to align the schools but T2 confirmed only one school is still showing in HRW and TCT. This is leading to thousands of roster errors because the schools don't exist. The schools aligned in Ed need to also be aligned in TCT and HRW.

User(s) Affected: Mary Doty

Replication Steps:
1. Log into HRW and TCT support
TCT UN: mary.doty@vertexeducation.com
HRW UN: DADMINISTRAT226 

For TCT: 
2. Hover over District and Schools
3. Click Manage under Schools

For HRW:
2. On the left sidebar, click Schools
3. Click View Schools

# The reported issue looks similar to the [https://nwea.atlassian.net/browse/CSI-166678|https://nwea.atlassian.net/browse/CSI-166678|smart-link]  where few Schools under the reported district are mapped with the ftype “09” which is not supposed to be.
# Ftype *09* implies that the organization is a private school without any parent organization.
# Few organizations where mapped with ftype “*05*” and tagged with the district pid as *11913959*. To make the schools mapped to the reported district, the ftype of all the schools should be updated as “*07*” only then they can be listed under the district.
# But here we have the organizations(schools) mapped to the district *11913959* as parent organization but with ftype 09. Even in CLM Database we have the same Organization_type_id as 9.
# In all three platforms(TC/HMO/CLM), we have the same ftype mapping and parent organization mapping.

*Note*: We have only one organization “Legacy Trad Schl-Legacy Online” with ftype 07 and it is displayed as expected.

Could someone from Order Management Team help us in fixing the Organization ftypes we have in the reported districts.

For the reported district “*Legacy Traditional Schs Vertex - 11913959*”, we have the schools mapped with different ftypes(05,09) instead of “07”.

Kindly review this from your end and fix the organization mapping issues.

The organization Cherokee Charter Academy (12475209) was resynced from *ELM* to *TC/HMO* platforms and now it was available in both platforms. 

Re-importing the latest batch will resolve the 1943 import error. Hence resolving the issue.

The 1210 errors are legitimate. They are administrator accounts that conflict with existing manually created accounts. If the district want’s to import these admins, they will need to delete, or change the usernames on, the manual accounts.

The org is inactive in HCP 2.0 and thus mapped to delete district in HMO and TC. We need to update MDM to make it active. I see that the org is synced with invalid ftype 09 instead of 07 from MDM. I noticed this only after trying to sync so now HMO / TC might also affected with invalid ftype.

The last update to this org was on 11-SEP-2025 where they changed the active status and ftype through MDM. Here is entry from organizations_audit table in CLM.

Please reach out to Order Management team if you need to make this org active and correct the ftype.

Thanks,
Gokul

Also the student is showing as active in a older class created in *16-08-22* *E65AB70FAC96452CE0530100007F95F4	2022-SECOND GRADE-Landis-Denise.*

The above older class has the below products which is showing in the Student login.

*As per design, the student login will contain the products which are mapped to the classes the student belongs to. So the reported student is shown with both the old class and the current year class products.*

Checking whether the student can be archived from the older class created around 2022 to remove the products from the student login.

We have updated the student status to *Archived* in the class “E65AB70FAC96452CE0530100007F95F4 : 2022-SECOND GRADE-Landis-Denise” which is being created by 2022.

Now the student login contains only the products from the current school year class with Grade 5 products.

Thank you for reaching out and for the update. We wanted to inform you that, after visiting multiple classrooms at different grade levels, we are still seeing the issue. Students can see their current teacher's resources, but they still see past grade levels as well. 

I have created screencast videos to show you what we are experiencing. We hope this will help us clarify our needs.  

The first video is of a teacher's dashboard. The things we would love your support with are:
1. Removing old classes from previous years. This way, the teacher only sees their current class of students.
2. Understanding why students do not see an updated dashboard when the current teacher removes all other grade level resources and updates it with current grade level resources.

[Teacher Dashboard Video Link|https://app.screencastify.com/watch/k0hq7wdXSDmukRaX0h9C]

The second video is of a student's dashboard. The things we would love your support with are:
1. Having a student's dashboard or ""My Library"" only has current grade level resources.

On validating the user given in the description, [lfortgang@ausd.net|mailto:lfortgang@ausd.net] we could see only a single class with Grade 5.

But the in the Video shared for Teacher dashboard, we could see a different Teacher user name *Wendi Kruger*.

Verified the Classes available for the user [wkruger@ausd.net|mailto:wkruger@ausd.net] as well and could see only one class active with Grade 5.

Adding both the Database and UI screenshot for reference.

Hi [~accountid:712020:40b4e410-9eb6-49fc-93fc-417163521ae3],

We could see 3 different organization mapping in HMO, TC and CLM DB we are not sure about which will be the correct one. Kindly check from your end and update it as expected to get the mentioned organization (Leman Acad Excellence-Marana) synced across all the platforms.

I cannot test it for test user as we don't have support portal to map the ISBNs.","08/Sep/25 4:37 AM;712020:ad7ca951-e27e-4c33-848e-52bf6fa1b3cc;While investigating in DB we could see that in HC_PLANNER_CONTENT table the product URL is *https://www-k6.thinkcentral.com/content/hsp/math/hspmath/na/common/mega_math_9780547585062_/*{color:#ff5630}*html*{color}*/hmh_mak6_mm_fa_nlm_lm_en/index.html?assignmentId=71457790&resourceId=4619481*

We have successfully replicated the reported issue and confirmed that the error *“401 – Unauthorized Access”* occurs consistently across all assessments.

Upon investigation, we found that when an assessment is accessed, it attempts to open the following URL, which fails because the content is not available in the production S3 bucket
[https://www-k6.thinkcentral.com/content/hsp/math/hspmath/na/common/mega_math_9780547585062_/html/hmh_mak6_mm_tng_ttt_la_en/index.html?assignmentId=71457791&resourceId=4619477|https://www-k6.thinkcentral.com/content/hsp/math/hspmath/na/common/mega_math_9780547585062_/html/hmh_mak6_mm_tng_ttt_la_en/index.html?assignmentId=71457791&resourceId=4619477]

The issue arises because the system is trying to load content from an html folder, which does not exist in the S3 bucket. Instead, the folder available is html5. 

Additionally, we reviewed the *Metadata planner XLSX file* located on SVN at:

[http://dubsvn.hmco.com/svn3/tck6content/data/content/hsp/math/texas_math_2015/tx/gr4/ete_9780544103702_/c-print/metadata-input/planner/|http://dubsvn.hmco.com/svn3/tck6content/data/content/hsp/math/texas_math_2015/tx/gr4/ete_9780544103702_/c-print/metadata-input/planner/]

We identified that the path associated with *GUID: GM_TX15E_ETE_G04U1M2L200_00150* is incorrect. It currently points to:

/content/hsp/math/hspmath/na/common/mega_math_9780547585062_/html/hmh_mak6_mm_fa_nlm_lm_en/index.html 

To resolve this issue, the incorrect path needs to be corrected in the metadata and then pushed to the environment.","10/Sep/25 4:42 AM;712020:b9c2d8a1-5373-4318-b443-aea9f892fff3;*Updates:*

But we could find *46* orgs (44 orgs with FTYPE - 10 and 2 orgs with FTYPE 07) mapped under the reported organization. The reported school *St Agnes School (00051578)* is one among those organizations and so the users are not able to find the school in login.","03/Sep/25 4:02 AM;557058:bb71b0f4-b983-46c1-803e-241a4d8a40a9;The *FTYPE* of the reported district *Diocese Of Oakland Ed Office (00051279)* was changed from *15* to *09* on *26-AUG-25* and currently it will treat as *Private School* but still we could find 46 organizations mapped under it.

*_Solutions :_*
1. We need to revert the FTYPE changes of the reported organization. 
2. Or else the 46 organizations have to be remapped to a district so that it will be listed in login screen.

Order Management team has to confirm on the above solutions to proceed further.

 As a result, we are unable to add or manage classes through the UI or via import.

This behaviour was also verified using a test user in the lower environment. While attempting to import the test teacher user into multiple classes within the same school, the import failed with a 00XX error.

Additionally, we noted that there are 17 active DA users in the district who have the ability to unlock Class Management.

1.When attempting to import the users and class mapping files via OneRoster while Class Management is locked, we encountered a 00xx error.

 2.Class Management is locked, we tried to importing user files (teacher and student) via OneRoster worked without any errors.

3.When class management lock is unlocked, Importing the users and class mapping files via OneRoster worked successfully without any errors. 

These outcomes were observed across our test users.   

We noticed that the input import files for batch ID 1847 also include the class mapping file for the reported user *dlara10@sisd.net*. Since class management is locked at the district level, the user is encountering error code 00XX. Kindly unlock the class management lock in district level and try to re-import the input file.

I think we will have to do a spike on this to understand what works well here on the timelines and best feasible solution.  

# When TC/HMO received a {{distpid}} that doesn’t exists in the {{ELSVC.ORGANIZATION}} table. Code logic can be written to validate if the distpid holds a cross reference entry in {{elsvc.idm_org_pid_update}} table and use the appropriate pid according to the business logic if exists otherwise fail the case as district doesn’t exists?
# From ELM pov we are passing the the correct distpid which is new pid on a cross reference but the expectation here is to send the old pid in dispid field incase of cross reference on a district level but elm message to TC/HMO hides a logic of being a cross reference in the parent level. Which in my opinion it should be transparent enough and we ideally be passing all the relevant info to the downstream as much as possible (_both old pid and new pid of distpid_) to HMO/TC. May be something like below and let HMO/TC to decide on it.
{noformat}<distPid>11723481</distPid>
<oldDistPid>00134091</oldDistPid>
<distPidRefId>46066458-7e7d-4924-92ec-b96147f51696</distPidRefId>{noformat}

     or 

{noformat}<distPid>00134091</distPid>
<crossRefDistPid>11723481</crossRefDistPid>
<distPidRefId>46066458-7e7d-4924-92ec-b96147f51696</distPidRefId>{noformat}



# We may need to do a one time exercise to see all the cross reference are in sync between ELM and TC/HMO - We need a backlog for this. 
# If there is a long term plan for TC/HMO for the next BTS, we can think of consuming the MDM sqs org event or kafka event from ELM and perform a call back to ELM get org API.

The license is currently assigned to [*ELSENER@CJACADEMY.ORG*|mailto:ELSENER@CJACADEMY.ORG], and since the license quantity is *1*, it cannot be reassigned unless it is first removed.
As per the system design, *only the admin* can reassign the license. However, in this case, the license is not being removed from the current user, which prevents reassignment.

To proceed, we have two options:

# *Manually remove* the license from the current admin and assign it to Gretchen Geerts.
# *Increase the license count* to allow assignment without needing to remove the existing one.

If reassignment without removal is a desired feature, this would require a *new enhancement request*.

Since this is working as designed, I am closing the ticket. Please feel free to reopen if further assistance is needed.
Thank you!

 Could I please get clarification on this T3 resolution? The admin wants to unassign the license that is currently assigned, but the LTL system doesn't give her that ability. It doesn't display the assigned user to allow her to unassign to assign to the correct account. Admin cannot reassign because they cannot unassign the license. They don't need an increase because Gretchen is the only teacher that needs a license. I've included a screenshot that doesn't show the licensed user to unassign the license from.


Additionally:
I read through the full notes, and it shows that ELSENER@CJACADEMY.ORG is assigned the license, but clearly the license doesn't show it's assigned and it can't be removed.

And that is the correct account:

After a detailed investigation, I’ve identified the *root cause* of the issue: the license was mistakenly assigned to a *student account* — *morgan.sims* (Source ID: u20).

As per system design, only *admins and teachers* are listed in the licensing page. Since Morgan is a student, the license appeared as ""assigned"" but the user was not visible, which prevented unassignment or reassignment.

I’ve attached screenshots of the *database License* and *OneRosterUser  screen* where the issue was identified.

⚠️ *Important Note:* Only *admins or teachers with rostering access* can assign, remove, or manage licenses. Regular teacher accounts do not have these permissions.

To proceed, please let me know if you'd like me to:{quote}

* Remove the license from *morgan.sims* and reassign it to the correct user, or
* If you're okay to proceed with the steps on your end.

{quote}Additionally, I’ve raised a BR ticket (*BR-26312*) to investigate who originally assigned the license to the student. I’ll update the ticket once the database backup is available and I have more details.

Looks like the https://nwea.atlassian.net/browse/BR-26312 is opened but doesn't look like it's actually fixed","05/Sep/25 12:10 AM;712020:ce251a5d-ebe0-4951-bb6c-08aca642a1cc;Just to clarify, the issue has already been resolved and the fix has been shared in the ticket.
The BR ticket (BR-26312) was raised only for verification purposes — specifically, to check whether morgan.sims was uploaded as a teacher during rostering at the time the license was assigned. This is purely for audit and tracking and does not impact the resolution or functionality of the license itself.

The actual issue was caused by the license being mistakenly assigned to a student account, which is why the user wasn’t visible in the licensing UI. I’ve already provided the steps to resolve this, and also replicated the scenario in a demo environment to confirm the behavior and validate the fix.

Please let me know if you’d like me to proceed with removing the license from morgan.sims and reassigning it to the correct user, or if you're okay to proceed with the steps on your end.

Replication Below:
1. logged into HMH Ed/Impersonated District Admin's account
2. Selected License Tab
3. Selected HMH Go Measure Math
4. scrolled down to view the Beginning, Middle, End of the year assessment dates.
5. then selected the Home tab at the top
6. Scrolled down and selected ""Select Dates"" in the Rostering Overview box
7. inspected that the dates in fact did not reflect what was in MHM Go Measure Math. 
8. Repeated steps 2
9. Repeated steps 3, but for HMH Growth Measure Reading
10. scrolled down and viewed the assessment dates for beginning, middle, and end of year 
11. repeated step 5 
12. repeated step 6
13. inspected that dates in fact did not reflect what was in HMH Growth Measure Reading.

Troubleshooting: requested remote assistance via screen share to verify everything was done correctly and to see the same issue was similar.

NOTES: provided a screen share to get accurate details on the discrepancies showing up and saw that the dates she had inputted were for September but when she goes to home and does a rostering overview to see the assessment dates, they are all showing incorrect end dates.


Does this affect more than 1 teacher/student/admin: Admin
Does this affect the entire district/school: District

Expected Result: Dates of each assessment should reflect what the District Admin placed for each program's assessment dates within Licensing.

Actual Result: Dates are being shown completely incorrect and not reflecting what the Admin had originally inputted within each program under Licensing.","Desktop/PC

Doesn't look like any issue for UDS. The BOY, MOY and EOY dates set in the ""My Milestones"" and ""Admin Dashboard"" are for ""reminders"" only and they're getting set fine.

The BOY, MOY and EOY returned by Wormhole on the Licencing page are stored in a separate system. There is no integration between UDS and Wormhole.

The UI team who have created the Admin Countdown timer widget have confirmed that they are storing BOY, MOY, EOY dates in 2 systems (UDS, Wormhole) and they aren't aligned.
This seems to be a mismatch between 2 different pages, which creates/stores dates in 2 different ways","07/Nov/25 6:21 AM;712020:dbf0b704-700b-4a7e-8673-f6b5df51e371;Thanks [~accountid:5a535bfc7e225d2911978536] !

## And for each line cross verify if that is entitled in CLM successfully. 
## And for each line find the cases where we haven’t hold any acknowledgement from HCP IA. Now here the failure scenarios could be the below. 
### CLM failed to emit the OrderCreatedEvent for some reason. 
### CLM emitted the OrderCreatedEvent and for some reason HCP IA is not able to process it. 
### CLM emitted the OrderCreatedEvent and HCP IA processed the event but failed to Acknowledge back.

# Now make this SQL into a repo class to accept the days as parameters and use systimestamp - N days logic in the API

Testing on Cert is complete, and there are a few defect to report with the Writing Task (basic) and Writable (prem) integrations. 

I believe the issues link back to the addition configuration work detailed in the attached doc [^HMH eng tasks_Writable for Into Reading TX v2.pptx]  

Writing Task integration defect 

(1) student dashboard is not displaying Writing Task LTI launch

Writable integration defects
(1) student dashboard is not displaying Writable LTI launch
(2) Writable for Into Reading upsell program name should not display in Class Program Settings
(3) Writable for Into Reading upsell program name should not display in Discover DD menu

For the Writable for Into Reading TX, we likely need two tickets:

# Ticket to apply exclusion logic for Writable for Into Reading TX v2; programs WRB_ELA_IR_G3_TX_V2, WRB_ELA_IR_G4_TX_V2, and WRB_ELA_IR_G5_TX_V2 are appearing in Class Program Settings in INT/CERT.
# Ticket to add Writable for Into Reading TX v2 programs to the student dashboard:
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G3_TX_V2
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G4_TX_V2
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G5_TX_V2

Additionally, we may need a third ticket for a defect. In production, the Writable for Into Reading V3 National programs are appearing in Class Program Settings:

# Ticket to check exclusion logic for production bug:
#* Writable for Into Reading V3 program names WRB_ELA_IR_G3_NA_V3, WRB_ELA_IR_G4_NA_V3, and WRB_ELA_IR_G5_NA_V3 are appearing in Class Program Settings.

Regarding the above added excel file for subscription palm mapping

For the ISBN - *9798202163982* the requested context to add is

|9780358983279|IM_NL_2025_G06_EN|NO|

|{color:#4c9aff}*9780358983323*{color}|{color:#4c9aff}*IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN*{color}|NO|

but in the support tool we could observe that the program_code *IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN* is already present with child isbn 9780358983460

|[9780358983460|https://support-app.br.hmheng.io/mappings-search?isbn=9780358983460]|IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN|

fyi For MATH we have a special offer to the customer that when they purchase grades 6-8 they also get access to Algebra 1.
this allows algebra to be taught to the lower grades for advanced students.

for 9780358983460 my file is correct too. A teacher gets both the student 9780358983323 and the teacher license 9780358983460

I reopened this due to a handful of errors in the subscription mapping
There are a several contexts that are duplicated between the two different subscription ids. We want unique contexts only 
For example this isbn 9798202066955 has two subscriptions #1168 and #1169

this context  NATIONAL,Spanish,3013B120105 is in both subscriptions
therefore please delete duplicates per the below table

[https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Ed-Core/elm/pull/972/files#diff-55be70cd43ca376b8b75ba17627d11f47f6617ed9abebd9fc2730495a53b0bef|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Ed-Core/elm/pull/972/files#diff-55be70cd43ca376b8b75ba17627d11f47f6617ed9abebd9fc2730495a53b0bef]

performing validations for bundle existence synchronously is difficult as it involves a middle ware call which might impact performance of the endpoint

there are few red cross marks in the Notebook 

Service defines a version tag   ❌ 

 Resolution: The deployment should add an version tag as [documented publically|https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes#configuration-1]

Sirish : I have gone through the document and I think we need to add service tag this is the service tag found for prod env please confirm this 
dd { env	: prod
        service : clm-oac 
        version :  0.0.3-12-2025712332 }



Service logging an appropriate rate ❌ 

 Resolution: Logs must provide value, single or multiple log lines per request is not appropriate usage.

Sirish : I checked [logs|https://houghton-mifflin-harcourt.datadoghq.com/logs?query=service%3Aclm-oac&agg_m=count&agg_m_source=base&agg_t=count&cols=host%2Cservice&fromUser=true&messageDisplay=inline&refresh_mode=sliding&storage=hot&stream_sort=desc&viz=stream&from_ts=1756191929035&to_ts=1756192829035&live=true] of clm-oac I could not find any multiple logs So I think we can update this to green 

APM service follows [Unified Service Tagging|https://houghton-mifflin-harcourt.datadoghq.com/notebook/8397518/service-catalog-item-review-template#unified-service-tagging] for the service catalog entry ❌ 

 Resolution: Application must follow the [Unified Service Tagging|https://houghton-mifflin-harcourt.datadoghq.com/notebook/8397518/service-catalog-item-review-template#unified-service-tagging] standard

Sirish : I checked the [document|https://houghton-mifflin-harcourt.datadoghq.com/notebook/8397518/service-catalog-item-review-template#unified-service-tagging]  the part which include updating in  [spread sheet |https://houghton-mifflin-harcourt.datadoghq.com/u?source=hyperlink&target=https%3A%2F%2Fhmhco.app.box.com%2Fs%2Fsmnqw6ptuge44aon303afk55yl99wc9n&author=datadog-user&hash=ZVMZkNc5p85rmCxE0gW37e4uYDp%2BVxA1vMrjgVRUbdY%3D] is completed  I need help in the remaining    part in the document
