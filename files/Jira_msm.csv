As part of *CHG0823681*, the Reporting Service instances were stopped and the complete termination will be done on *23rd October* after a certain grace period.

After stopping the instances, we got pager duty alerts and then the corresponding Test run related to Reporting Service was skipped. 

Now the Satellite Application test run contains only Adaptive service and Assignment service test runs.

We will maintain ""[TIM_Quaterly_unique_logins|https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/1706677950648]"" file in box, which will be updated on quarterly basis for Analytics purpose. Tim can fetch the Unique Login counts for both TC & HMO every quarter from this file.

 

Additionally, the monthly count for both the applications is available in the following box links.

TC: [https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/760317010045?s=8rzxqim1yyszkexyypxsnrkllaym1nof]

HMO: [https://hmhco.app.box.com/file/859755143885?s=s7rjgxjcr7ux2sepb7rotfv1xf5p569a]

 

{*}Definition{*}: 

*Total number of unique logins –* Under this metric if the same user logs in 50 times a day, they will be counted once. However, the same user is counted as unique every day.

*Total number of logins –* All logins to a platform in a month. Counts multiple logins for the users in a day. (eg: if user A logs in 5 times a day, the login count will be 5 for that user).

 

{*}ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA{*}:
 * extract the reports for TC and HMO

* *Melody Zeitler* is licensed for LTL, enrolled in 5 classes (Murtha, Severson, Barkley, Cayaban, Lowry), and has both *teacher* and *admin* roles.
* *Leah Cayaban* is licensed and enrolled in the *Cayaban* class.
* *Courtney Lowry* is licensed and enrolled in the *Lowry* class.

All users should now be able to access their respective classes in LTL.

Regarding the Roster menu issue: root account should typically allow enrollment. If it’s not working, it may be a permissions or UI issue. Recommend checking admin privileges or retrying via a different browser.

Is it possible to have a separate column for schools & Districts please?

We need this data to give a true reflection of entitlements i.e:

* districts buy one program, and if there are multiple subscriptions for same ISBN, with overlapping dates, then include only the one with the latest expiry date (furthest into the future).
* and do not have the same ISBN appear more than once for the same district.
* If we cannot tell which program they bought the ISBN under, then we can make a ‘best guess’ from the State value for the District e.g. if they are in CA, then we assume CA Journeys.",,Delcy Philips,Karthic Kumar Varadharaja Perumal,Nandini MS,557058:bb71b0f4-b983-46c1-803e-241a4d8a40a9,5bc9bfb867a5270a3a1c11aa,712020:701f1652-345d-45cc-8921-66a723c5d0bb,;24/Oct/25 9:24 AM;e59e863f-5032-4cbc-a925-fb2e872deb73;7200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,7200,,,0,7200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24/Oct/25 9:23 AM;e59e863f-5032-4cbc-a925-fb2e872deb73;HMO_Active_Entitlements_14910.xlsx;https://nwea.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/1137457,24/Oct/25 9:23 AM;e59e863f-5032-4cbc-a925-fb2e872deb73;TCK_Active_Entitlement_14910.xlsx;https://nwea.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/1137456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Under Review,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@3d6c5ca3,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What market problem are we solving?,,Which goal(s) or initiative(s) does this epic support?,,Are there any sequencing or dependencies to call out for this feature?,,How will we know we have solved the problem?,,Please outline the app user roles and what goals they are trying to accomplish with this feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Under Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,,,Unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,americas.nwea.pvt,,,americas.nwea.pvt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{color:red}*{color}*Impact Rating and Probability Rating are required*{color:red}*{color},"{color:red}*{color}*Impact Rating, Probability Rating, and Mitigation Plan are required*{color:red}*{color}",{color:red}*{color}*If you choose Team as the Risk Level please select a Team below*{color:red}*{color},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data Fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AAD,,,,,,P3 (Low),,,,,,,1,,,150,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Under Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"h4.Engineering comments

h4. 1. *Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)*

h4.  2.*Run npm Commands in the Project Directory:*

h4. *i)* Once npm is installed and working, navigate to your project directory (where {{*package.json*}} is located) 

h4. cmd :    cd C:\HMH source code\HTE-770Dashboard\Application\HMH.WorkBench.UI, and then 

3.*Install express to required version*

*cmd:* npm install express@4.0.0.

Created a PR to upgrade package changes :[https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/548|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/548] Changes were pushed to the {{Dev}} branch, and the *""Retest now""* button was clicked in the Snyk portal to address the high vulnerability.
As a result, *1 high vulnerability ticket* dependent on this package was resolved.

and further I have updated this package to 4.17.3 which resolves 3 additional high vulnerabilities [https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/551|https://scm.eng.hmhco.com/Mature-Platforms/dashboard/pull/551]
*So, 4 High,5 medium,2 low vulnerability tickets* which are dependent on this have been *resolved*.

The reported SQL injection finding from Snyk is a *false positive*.

All database queries involved in the Assessments workflow use parameterized SQL via Oracle parameters and a custom SQLBuilder class, and no user-supplied input is ever concatenated into SQL strings.

Snyk traces HTTP parameters (to, from,classname)flowing into:

AssessmentFactory → StrategyFactory → IDbStrategy.Sql → Repo → OracleCommand.CommandText

because snyk cannot analyze our custom sqlbuilder, it assumes SQL is build using concatenation,even though it is not.this results in a false positive.

why this code is safe:

*1.SQL is built using SqlBuilder with parameter placeholders*

*Example :* 

[file:Application/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api.Basal/DataAccess/Assessments/AssessmentTcTeacher.cs|file:Application/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api.Basal/DataAccess/Assessments/AssessmentTcTeacher.cs]

Property: Sql

public override string Sql
{
    get
    {
        return new SqlBuilder()
            .Select(""ASSIGNED_STUDENTS"", ""ASSIGNMENT_ID"", ""ASSIGNMENT_NAME"", ""CLASSROOM_ID"",
                    ""CLASSROOM_NAME"", ""DUEDATE"", ""FIRSTNAME"", ""LASTNAME"", ""STUDENT_ID"",
                    ""TEACHER_USER_ID"", ""TEST_SCORE"")
            .From(""DASHBOARD_ASSESSMENT_SCORE"")
            .Where(""TEACHER_USER_ID"")
            .EqualTo("":TEACHER_USER_ID"")   // parameter placeholder, NOT string concatenation
            .OrderBy(""DUEDATE desc"", ""ASSIGNMENT_NAME"")
            .ToString();
    }
} 

* -SQL contains parameter markers like: Teacher_USER_ID-
* -No user input is concatenated into SQL text-

*2.User inputs are passed strictly as parameters*

[File:AssessmentTcTeacher.cs|File:AssessmentTcTeacher.cs]

Property: Params

public override Dictionary<string, object> Params
{
    get
    {
        return new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { ""TEACHER_USER_ID"", this.userId }
        };
    }
}

* -Only safe dictionary values-
* -No string concatenation-

*3.Database access uses oracle parameter binding(safe)*

[File:Application/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api.Basal/DataAccess/Repo.cs|File:Application/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api/HMH.WorkBench.Platform.Api.Basal/DataAccess/Repo.cs] 

cmd.CommandText = strategy.Sql;
foreach (var para in strategy.Params)
{
    cmd.Parameters.Add(new OracleParameter(para.Key, para.Value));
}

* -OracleCommand uses parameteried queries-
* -Prevents any SQL injection regardless of input-
* -No raw input ever reaches SQL-

*4*.*HTTP parameters (*{{to}}*,* {{from}}*,* {{className}}*) are used ONLY for in-memory filtering*

They appear only in C# LINQ filters after the SQL query:

var filteredResuls = result.Where(r =>
    (this.to.CompareTo(DateTime.MaxValue) == 0 || r.DueDate <= [this.to|http://this.to]) &&
    (this.from.CompareTo(DateTime.MinValue) == 0 || r.DueDate > this.from) &&
    (string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.className) || this.className == r.ClassRoomName)
).ToList();

* -these values never touch SQL-
* -No SQL injection possible from these inputs.-

Conclusion:

* No SQL concatenation occurs in the codebase.
* All user-supplied values are sent through Oracle parameters.
* {{SqlBuilder}} always produces parameterized SQL.
* Repo binds parameters safely using {{OracleParameter}}.
* The flagged data flow does *not* represent a real SQL injection vector.

*Therefore, this is a false positive and no code change is needed*.

Hi [~accountid:712020:947e03ab-bf6d-4e2a-b0bf-287789ae4ae1]  As per the analysis, can we mark this occurrence as a false positive?

request = sanitizeRequest(request);

 

However, *this did not resolve the SSRF issue*, as the root cause lies earlier in the flow — where headers are first set on the request object (e.g., line 593). Sanitizing at invokeRequest is too late since tainted input already flows in.

 

I’ve *reverted the changes* and will now explore applying validation earlier, when the request is first built.","08/Jul/25 10:09 PM;712020:a76c41c5-a31f-4548-8c22-27508989206c;The recent SSRF mitigation using *sanitizeRequest() before httpClient.request() didn’t resolve the issue.* Based on the data flow, the vulnerability likely originates earlier in the request lifecycle.

This ticket will track the actions taken towards it.

Steps to follow:

* Delete/remove old AMIs and keep only recent AMI 
* Raise a BR ticket to remove/delete the AMIs
* Once a BR is closed, check with Infosec to see if that’s reflecting in ORCA & if number of vulnerabilities is reduced for Mature.

I have investigated this issue, and it appears that *SyncOrgs* does not return the school with *PID: 12657017*. As a result, *FIS* does not emit a payload for that school, which means that all resources associated with it (teachers, students, etc.) are not being imported.

[~accountid:712020:79ac2def-ac34-4452-9bf0-c93abd994acb] can you investigate this one, here is CURL of SyncOrg request:

Teacher was able to assign this assessment to their students, prior to the expiration date of the licenses. However, now that the entitlement has expired, students are unable to work on the test anymore. Growth Reports are also not showing for this teacher, for this reason.

However, customer can view the Growth Reports for the students that have completed the test before he expiration date, in Admin Growth Reports. For example, 16 students that had completed the test, are showing their FLA test results in Admin Growth Reports of Grade 1. See below:

Requesting to *reupload the roster under the returning user flow* and ensure that the classes are correctly mapped to the admin. This should resolve the issue and allow the admin to launch the LTL successfully.

This should be the actual response for the Class api:

Assign the user Joleen as a Teacher in the enrollment in all the classes .
In the User Management section, keep the user’s role as Administrator.
This setup will enable a separate launch button for the user, allowing them to access the LTL successfully.

In addition we have also verified whether the students are able to take FLA tests entire district wide. Last FLA test was taken by few students on 03/10/2025 as well. So students are not facing any issues now.
We had a deployment for Spring Boot Upgrade on 09/12 and since then we were seeing this issues with FLA launch. We tried restarting the servers today in IST timings on 09/19 and issue got resolved.
Please inform the customer to verify now and reach out if any issues.

However, I do not see that today, I see a 200 response on that.

Taking first studentPersonalRefId in the response in previous comment, it is an inactive user. Per the HCP 1 info on USC, it may have been updated on 8th Sept 2025.

If we grab the username from this inactive user, and look it up, we find that there is now a different Ref ID on that user - a36d9f88-77ee-4388-823e-8a5947f95ac0. See below.

The Student User Ref ID is what ties them to the assignment. The customer appears to have changed the LASID values on the students, which results in a new Ref ID. 

It looks like the assignment here was taken on 4th Sept (per the response JSON in previous comment), while users were updated on 8th Sept. 

We don’t support that change i.e. to remap the users to the assignment, if the customer changes up their rostering to that degree after they have started assignments.

 As per the functionality any new order will over ride the previous orders.

Hence, the latest order which was processed on *17-09-24* with *Sales Order No. 0097192214 &* *subscription end date* of *16-09-25 will over ride the previous* Order.

The students who experienced the glitch (in my class and others) were in the process of taking the Growth Measure assessment. They had completed a large portion of the test and were at the end of doing nonsense words. I do not know which question they were doing, but it was during the nonsense word portion of the assessment (3 word choices, and they were supposed to listen to the word spoken and select the word that looked like what they heard). Every child who experienced the glitch answered one of these questions, and the next page that popped up was the error page that told students to get help from the teacher because there was a technical issue.","09/Oct/25 9:59 AM;70121:6c18a1e2-ebad-4be1-a1e6-268664609a10;Sample student UN: [gidcumbz37@okemosk12.net|mailto:gidcumbz37@okemosk12.net]

We have conducted a detailed investigation into the customer's issue. During our testing using a School Admin account, we identified that _Grade 1_ and _Grade 2_ were not visible. To further evaluate the issue, we also tested multiple Teacher accounts and confirmed that _Grade 1_ and _Grade Product_ were not appearing. Additionally, we verified the same with a District Admin account, and found that _Grade 1_ and _Grade Product_ were also not visible there. Please refer to below screenshot:

1. Makaio – This student is on the roster and has not been given an interview, but the report incorrectly shows that he participated in one.
2. Coral and Luke – Both students appear twice on the full class report. They only completed Interview 8, yet the data also shows additional Interviews 6 and 7, which they did not take.
3. Naomi – The report shows her as having completed Interview 7, but she only took Interview 4.
4. Aiden - This student in Jerome's class. He completed interview 6 and was submitted. Iis showing he only went up to question 6.6 and that he was given interview 7 and he was not given interview 7.

Pending response or closure. ,"30/Sep/25 8:13 AM;712020:cbb1168a-c517-41b1-925b-3ff13ff06879;Per Customer: Makaio's data continues to be incorrect. He is one of our students on campus who does not participate in any interviews. He has not participate in any interviews this year. As for the other students, interviews are still showing up that they were not administered. 

On a separate note, I have another 3rd grade teacher Elyssa Farmer, that appeared to show 2 interviews given to her entire class. Initially, she did not administer any interviews for the entire class, and data was showing up for each of her students from the previous year. She is the only teacher this happened to where it appears the previous year data transferred. We were not sure what happened but continued to interview her class, in which they have only done one interview but her data is showing both last year and this years data. She also shows up as a student in her data. 

This is not the same issue with Joshua's class, which is showing the exact opposite problem. ","01/Oct/25 12:20 AM;712020:ce251a5d-ebe0-4951-bb6c-08aca642a1cc;Thank you for the additional clarification.

As per the system’s functionality, the reporting view is designed to show all interviews administered by the class teacher, including those from previous academic years for existing students. For new users, only the current year’s interview data will be displayed.

Based on our validation:

* *Makaio* has completed Interviews 7 and 8, which are correctly reflected in the report. If he was not intended to participate, this may need to be reviewed at the data entry or assignment level.
* The discrepancies observed in *Elyssa Farmer’s* class are consistent with expected behavior for returning students, where previous year data is retained. Her appearance as a student may be due to a role configuration issue .
* *Joshua’s class* shows data aligned with the current year and teacher assignments, and no reporting deviations were found.

All of the students are returning students with the exception of a few and those that moved on to middle school,"06/Oct/25 10:59 PM;712020:ce251a5d-ebe0-4951-bb6c-08aca642a1cc;The reason Elyssa Farmer’s class shows interview data from the previous year while others do not is likely due to how user and class associations were carried over in the system.

If Elyssa retained the same class roster or student associations from the previous academic year, and those students are returning users, their historical interview data would continue to appear in the reporting view. This is expected behavior for returning students and teachers. In contrast, if other teachers had their rosters reset or reassigned for the new year, the system would only show data from the current academic year.

I have taken 6 orders from 4 customers (all districts) to produce the 6 SQL statement files (1 file per order, updating each affected child line item within each kit of the order), and the Cypher Detach statements (1 detach statement at ed_ref_id level, with the unique set of affected program_codes per org).

The *LIT_Limited_Sample_Orgs_RefIds_ProgramCodes.xslx* file holds the saved program codes per org for all of the affected lines. 

Note, these org’s may well have other Ed material, but this limited update is only targeting Into Lit kits. The orders prepresent all Into Lit kits that have been specified by the business as having a bundle that should migrate to a product bundle entitlement.

Steps:

# Save a copy of the affected SOLI rows before any updates into a temp table
# Update CLM with data extracted from SAP +and+ Insert into Event_Log - see attached 6 “*LIT_SQL*.txt*” files
# Trigger the affected orders to generate OrderCreatedEvent to pass the order data to HCP
# Re-trigger the affected orders to OAC
# Confirm that OrderCreatedEvent got generated
# Confirm OAC was updated
# Perform clean-up OAC to remove the programs without the PBID - one command per org - see “*LIT_Limited_Sample_Detach.txt*” file",,Naveenkumar

Testing on Cert is complete, and there are a few defect to report with the Writing Task (basic) and Writable (prem) integrations. 

I believe the issues link back to the addition configuration work detailed in the attached doc [^HMH eng tasks_Writable for Into Reading TX v2.pptx]  

Writing Task integration defect 

(1) student dashboard is not displaying Writing Task LTI launch

Writable integration defects
(1) student dashboard is not displaying Writable LTI launch
(2) Writable for Into Reading upsell program name should not display in Class Program Settings
(3) Writable for Into Reading upsell program name should not display in Discover DD menu

For the Writable for Into Reading TX, we likely need two tickets:

# Ticket to apply exclusion logic for Writable for Into Reading TX v2; programs WRB_ELA_IR_G3_TX_V2, WRB_ELA_IR_G4_TX_V2, and WRB_ELA_IR_G5_TX_V2 are appearing in Class Program Settings in INT/CERT.
# Ticket to add Writable for Into Reading TX v2 programs to the student dashboard:
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G3_TX_V2
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G4_TX_V2
#* WRB_ELA_IR_G5_TX_V2

Additionally, we may need a third ticket for a defect. In production, the Writable for Into Reading V3 National programs are appearing in Class Program Settings:

# Ticket to check exclusion logic for production bug:
#* Writable for Into Reading V3 program names WRB_ELA_IR_G3_NA_V3, WRB_ELA_IR_G4_NA_V3, and WRB_ELA_IR_G5_NA_V3 are appearing in Class Program Settings.

please complete this asap for the 10/1 go live- which we need sooner for CERT testing ie complete 9/19","18/Sep/25 4:15 AM;712020:e47b03bd-42a7-40cf-a27b-13c52525e05b;Hi [~accountid:712020:53d77875-0aae-44b6-8221-f713fa3f90fd] ,

Regarding the above added excel file for subscription palm mapping

For the ISBN - *9798202163982* the requested context to add is

|9780358983279|IM_NL_2025_G06_EN|NO|
|9780358983286|IM_NL_2025_G07_EN|NO|
|9780358983293|IM_NL_2025_G08_EN|NO|
|{color:#4c9aff}*9780358983323*{color}|{color:#4c9aff}*IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN*{color}|NO|

but in the support tool we could observe that the program_code *IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN* is already present with child isbn 9780358983460

|[9780358983460|https://support-app.br.hmheng.io/mappings-search?isbn=9780358983460]|IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN|

!Screenshot (1333).png|width=1440,height=603,alt=""Screenshot (1333).png""!

So could you please confirm whether the program_code *IM_NL_2025_AL1_EN* should be mapped with child isbn *9780358983460*, *9780358983323* or with both the child isbn’s.

yes for parent *9798202163982 please add* {color:#4c9aff}*9780358983323*{color}
fyi For MATH we have a special offer to the customer that when they purchase grades 6-8 they also get access to Algebra 1.
this allows algebra to be taught to the lower grades for advanced students.

for 9780358983460 my file is correct too. A teacher gets both the student 9780358983323 and the teacher license 9780358983460
Thank you Deepika for questioning this in case we had made an error!

I reopened this due to a handful of errors in the subscription mapping
There are a several contexts that are duplicated between the two different subscription ids. We want unique contexts only 
For example this isbn 9798202066955 has two subscriptions #1168 and #1169

this context  NATIONAL,Spanish,3013B120105 is in both subscriptions
therefore please delete duplicates per the below table
